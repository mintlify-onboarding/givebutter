### Installing the Widgets library

If you haven't already, [Install the Widgets library](/widgets/getting-started).

### Widget

Once you've installed the Widgets library, you can embed a form anywhere on your website. To get started, visit your Givebutter Dashboard and select the campaign you're looking to embed. Then visit the Sharing tab and select Widgets in the sidebar. Copy the code as it appears in the dashboard and place it on your site:

```html HTML
<givebutter-widget id="{YOUR_WIDGET_ID}"></givebutter-widget>
```

### Manual Embed

If you want to manually embed many donation forms, you could use the `<givebutter-form></givebutter-form>` HTML tag instead. Simply pass the options as below:

`<givebutter-form campaign="{YOUR_CAMPAIGN_CODE}"></givebutter-form> `
