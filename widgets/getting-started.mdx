### Installing the library

Installing Widgets is fast and easy. Simply add the following code snippet inside the `<head></head>` tag of your website and we'll take care of the rest. Be sure to replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID` with the Account ID found in your Dashboard. We recommend including the code snippet on every page of your site.

```html HTML
<script async src="https://widgets.givebutter.com/latest.umd.cjs?acct={YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID}"></script>
```

### Embedding Widgets

Once you've installed the Widgets library, you can embed a widget anywhere on your website. To get started, visit your Givebutter Dashboard and select the campaign you're looking to embed. Then visit the Sharing tab and select Widgets in the sidebar. Follow the prompts on the screen to embed your widget.
