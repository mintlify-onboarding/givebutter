### Installation

If you haven't already, [Install the Elements library](/docs/elements-install).

Then, add the following HTML snippet on your page:

```html HTML
<div givebutter-element="button" givebutter-campaign="YourCampaignCode"></div>
```

### Attaching to an existing button

The button elements supports several themes designed to match your websites design.

`givebutter-theme="click-only"` will create a button out of any existing HTML element. This can be used on any HTML element, such as buttons, links or images, and will show a donation form when clicked!

```html HTML
<button
  givebutter-element="button"
  givebutter-campaign="YourCampaignCode"
  givebutter-theme="click-only"
>
  Donate!
</button>
```

There is also a `text-only` theme for dynamic elements that will keep your existing styles, but update the contents of the element with whatever label you pick in the dashboard. This allows you to add a dynamic button to your site that you can control through the Givebutter Dashboard.  
When using the `text-only` theme only the campaign and label settings in the Dashboard will be used. (Color and other styling settings are not applied)

```html HTML
<button givebutter-element-id="1234" givebutter-theme="text-only">
  Donate!
</button>
```
