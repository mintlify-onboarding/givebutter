### Overview

Donation events are fired at various steps during the donation flow.

This allows you to integrate donation events directly into your existing tracking code.

You can also use these events to update the page or show a custom thank you message once a donation is complete.

### Creating an Event Listener

You can attach an event listener using the `window.Givebutter.addEventListener` function. This function is available immediately after include the Loader. You do not need to wait for `EVENT.READY` to add listeners;

```java JavaScript
window.Givebutter(
    'addEventListener',
    window.Givebutter.EVENT.DONATION.STARTED, // use defined constant or raw code
    function(donationObj) {
	      // Track the donation
    }
);
```

### Donation Object

Donations event callbacks receive a donation object as the only parameter.

```java javaDonationEventObject
{
  givebutter: true, // Always set to true
  dataFormat: 1.0, // Format version
  event: 'donation.started', // Event Name
  total: 0, // Total Donation
  frequency: 'once', // Payment Frequency,
  method: 'card', // Payment Method
  currency: 'USD', // Currency
  campaign: { // Campaign Data
      code: 'my-campaign', // Campaign Code
      title: 'My Campaign', // Campaign Title
      url: 'https://givebutter.com/my-campaign/'  // Campaign URL,
  },
  sessionId: // Unique Session ID
}
```

### Donation Started Event

**Code:** `donation.started`  
**Constant:** Givebutter.EVENT.DONATION.STARTED

**Description:**  
The `donation.started` event occurs when a user completes the first step of the donation flow.

### Donation Paying Event

**Code:** `donation.paying`  
**Constant:** Givebutter.EVENT.DONATION.PAYING

**Description:**  
The `donation.paying` event occurs when a user is on the final step of the donation flow and is being asked for payment details.

### Donation Complete Event

**Code:** `donation.complete`  
**Constant:** Givebutter.EVENT.DONATION.COMPLETE

**Description:**  
The `donation.complete` event occurs when a user is finished the donation flow.

<Warning>
  **Verifying a Donation**

The `donation.complete` event is fired inside the browser and could be faked by a malicious user.

If you need to verify a donation you can use the `donationObj.sessionId` to confirm the donation is finished and see what items were purchased. See the API documentation for more details.
