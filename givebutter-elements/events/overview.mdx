### Overview

Events listeners allow you to take action when certain things occur.

In order to listen for events, call the `addEventListener` method of the `window.Givebutter` object.

The `window.Givebutter.addEventListener` function is available immediately after including the library. You do **not** need to wait for the [ready](#ready-event) event to fire.

```java JavaScript
window.Givebutter( 'addEventListener', eventName, function(givebutter) { // Handle event });
```

### Library Events

#### beforeLoad

The `beforeLoad` event occurs Immediately after the library is initialized, but before the page is finished loading.

**Name:** `beforeLoad`  
**Constant:** Givebutter.EVENT.BEFORE_LOAD  
**Parameters:** `givebutter` (Givebutter elements library instance)

```java JavaScript
window.Givebutter( 'addEventListener', window.Givebutter.EVENT.BEFORE_LOAD, // use defined constant or 'beforeLoad' function(givebutter) { // Elements is ready and accessible via the givebutter variable (or window.Givebutter) // but the page may not have finished loading yet } );
```

#### load

The `load` event occurs when the library is finished loading and the DOM is ready, but before the widgets are initialized.

Some of the things you may want to do at this step include:

- Dynamic configuration changes
- Load additional themes
- Over-ride or extend widget methods

**Name:** `load`  
**Constant:** Givebutter.EVENT.LOAD  
**Parameters:** `givebutter` (Givebutter elements library instance)

```java JavaScript
window.Givebutter( 'addEventListener', window.Givebutter.EVENT.LOAD, // use defined constant or 'load' function(givebutter) { // Elements is ready and accessible via the givebutter variable (or window.Givebutter) // but findWidgets() has not been called yet } );
```

#### ready

The `ready` event is a special type of event that is guaranteed to only be called once. Unlike the `load` event, the `ready` listener will be fired immediately if the Givebutter Elements library is already loaded. To use any other methods you'll need to wait for the `ready` event by attaching an event listener as shown in the example below.

**Name:** `ready`  
**Constant:** Givebutter.EVENT.READY  
**Parameters:** `givebutter` (Givebutter elements library instance)

```java JavaScript
window.Givebutter( function(givebutter) { // Elements is ready and accessible via the givebutter variable (or window.Givebutter) // Themes and widgets may still be loading } ); `
```
